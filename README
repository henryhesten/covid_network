### INTRODUCTION ###
This is a model for simulating how covid will spread through a network of people.
You will need basic python knowledge to use this model
You will also need to provide some of the probabilities. Look here: https://www.microcovid.org

It is a marcov simulation, this means that whenever the simulation could do one of multiple things it chooses one a random
E.g. if there is a 1 in 6 change that a person is infected, it rolls a dice and infects them if it is a 1
Therefore to get a good idea of what could happen you need to run multiple simulations
In tests/simple.py you can see that there is a function single_interation(). This runs a *single* marcov trial
This function is run 1000 times in the code below. In each of these 1000 simulations the people Harold and Sophie are
 infected at different times. These times are then plotted

These are the rules for how people are infected:
1. Each person has a background probability of infection each day, from sources NOT covered in the rest of the simulation
2. Each person has a list of specific significant events which can infect them. E.g. going to a restaurant.
   Each of these events has a probability of infecting them
3. Each person may be infected by another person in the network via an "interaction"

When a person gets symptoms they warn the other people in the network that they have been in contact with in the previous 15 days
These people in the network then warn anyone they were in contact with after that point, and so on
It is assumed that anyone who has symptoms, or has been warned of potential infections will NOT interact further
People can be labeled as "untrustworthy" in which case they still see people when they have symptoms

Once infected the person has a 57.5% chance of developing symptoms.
The time between infection and symptoms is log-normally distributed
The person becomes infectious a random time before or after developing symptoms (or when they would have developed symptoms if they are asymptomatic)
The infected person has a constant (over time) level of infectiousness for a random period after becoming infectious
The probabilities of spreading infection defined in the model are for symptomatic people, in asymptomatic people this is reduced to 10% (i.e. by 90%)

The main danger from your friends is transmission before symptoms, or from asymptomatic people
This is because you should not see your friends when they have symptoms
The probability of dying is not simulated, because long covid is highly likely, bad and should be avoided

It is best used to answer a specific question e.g.
Given that I saw Rosi on Wednesday, and she lives with a doctor and another flatmate. If I see Sophie on Sunday what is
the chance of me infecting her?
To run many simulations until Sophie has been infected at least 25 times. The error in most outputs of this model is
equal to the square root of the number of events. This means that Sophie has actually been infected between 15 and 35
times (for 2 standard deviations). Then count the total number of applicable simulations
Which simulations are applicable is not trivial. For example, on Sunday morning you will know for that noone in your network
has reported symptoms. You should therefore remove all simulations where someone reported symptoms from the total number
of simulations. What you are left with after this is the set of simulations that actually could happen (or actually are happening)

The file test/test_certain_kath simulates what happens if katie is almost certain to catch covid before Harold sees her
This simulation was created because it is easier to see what is going on with larger infection rates.
Large numbers of simulations where no-one is infected are not useful

test/test_reasonable is the same as above by with more realistic base rates of infection

### INSTUCTIONS ###
I don't actually know the "proper" way to run python scripts. I run mine in pycharm.
All imports start with covid_network... so manage that however you usually do

1. Define each person, giving them a base rate of infection, based on their usual daily activities
2. Pick a starting day for the simulation, this should be approximately a month before anything interesting happens, see below
3. Define the events that happen to each person
   The days that the events happen on can be random, e.g. Wednesday OR Thursday
   The event can have a probability of occurring if it might not happen
4. Define the interactions between all people in the network. Interactions can involve multiple people
5. Create a Config object. If you want to change high level any simulation parameters, look here
6. Create an Infector object, this will do most of the simulation
7. Propagate the infector for a set number of days
8. The people objects will now have been updated with information about what happened
9. Read person.was_infected(), person.infected_on(), or which ever variable you are interested in

10. Once the above works for a *single* simulation put it in a function
11. Run that funciton a lot of times and record the outputs
12. Create a statistical summary of all those outputs
13. If you want to study how the statistical summary varies when you change the initial conditions, then put this block
    in a funciton as well

14. Make sure your answers are reasonable. E.g. if a person was never infected then you probably did something wrong,
    or need to increase the number of simulations
15. Share this with your friends, so they can also not die

Tips:
Start with small numbers of simulations until you know there are no bugs, they can take time to run
Be careful on what day you start the simulation. If you start too early with a high infection rate you may infect
the intial person (katie) too early, and they will have passed the contagious / presymptomatic phase before
the rest of your interactions happen
