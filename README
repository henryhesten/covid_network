This is a model for simulating how covid will spread through a network of people

It is a marcov simulation, this means that whenever the simulation could do one of multiple things it chooses one a random
E.g. if there is a 1 in 6 change that a person is infected, it rolls a dice and infects them if it is a 1
Therefore to get a good idea of what could happen you need to run multiple simulations
In tests/simple.py you can see that there is a function single_interation(). This runs a *single* marcov trial
This function is run 1000 times in the code below. In each of these 1000 simulations the people Harold and Sohpie are
 infected at different times. These times are then plotted
